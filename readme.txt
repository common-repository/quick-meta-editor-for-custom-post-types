This is a plugin to help you edit quickly the content of your custom post types.

== Description ==
This is a very simple plugin to help you edit quickly the content of your custom post types. It was created to improve the edition process. Instead of loading a new page for each post, then going back to the list, find another post to edit, and doing the process again, this plugin puts all posts and all meta data on a single page, for a specific custom post type.

= How it works =
This is pretty straightforward. First, you select a custom post type on the drop down menu. Then you will get a list of all the posts for this custom post type (limited to 1000 for usability). For each post you can edit each meta data it contains, just change the text input and press enter or tab, it will be updated immediately. 

To help you find your data, you can filter the content on two different ways. You can toggle the meta data you need with the checkboxes, this will only show the checked metas. You can also type any text in the filter text input, this will only show the posts with metas that include the text, it can be useful to find what you need, this is case-sensitive. Both filters can be used simultaneously.
